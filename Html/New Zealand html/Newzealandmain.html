                <h2>System of government</h2>
                <p>New Zealand is built on a system of government called a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch shares, or entirely hands over their power to rule the country to a democratically elected and constitutionally backed government. New Zealand, like many other members of the commonwealth shares King and/or Queen with the UK.</p>
                <p>Current King/Queen: King Charles III</p>
                <p>Current Prime minister: Christopher Luxon</p>

                <h2>The Māori people</h2>
                <p>The Māori people are the indigenous people of New Zealand. The Māori we know today are descendants of settlers who came to New Zealand from east Polynesia between 1320 and 1350. Their relationship with the European settlers varied at the start, but as was sadly often the case in British colonies, this fragile peace didn’t last.</p>
