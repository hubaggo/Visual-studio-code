                <h2>The Waitomo caves</h2>
                <p> <a href="https://www.waitomo.com/" target="_blank">The Waitomo caves</a> are a series of caves, connected by a river. The caves are known for their large population of glowworms. The glowworms light up the dark caves with blue and green luminescence, and it’s a sight quite unique to this location. As a visitor, you ride down the river in a boat and admire the beauty of these magical creatures. Alternatively, if you’re a thrill seeker, there is an option to go rafting down a different, yet equally beautiful cave.</p>
